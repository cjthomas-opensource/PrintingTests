Gear stands have 0, 10, 20, and 30 thou clearance between gears.
Gears have modules 100, 50, and 30.

Axle posts are 250 thou, holes are 275 thou, per axle tests.

Gears actually _work_ with 0 nominal clearance, roughly.
Clearance 10 turns easily with slight changes in torque.
Clearance 20 turns freely with slight rattle.

Module 50 works fine. Module 100 is overkill.
FIXME - Testing module 30.
