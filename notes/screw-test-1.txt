The screw test had arrays of holes for #2, #4, and #6 screws.


Nominal:

#2 - 70 tap, 85 shank, 95 clear
#4 - 90 tap, 110 shank, 130 clear
#6 - 110 tap, 140 shank, 160 clear


XY plane (hole axis Z):

#2 - 85 max tap, 100-105 min clear
#4 - 110 max tap, 130 min clear
#6 - 130 max tap, 150 min clear


XZ and YZ planes (hole axis X or Y):

#2 - 80 max tap, 95-100 min clear
#4 - 100 max tap, 120 min clear
#6 - 120 max tap, 140 min clear


...So, XY (hole Z) is small but others are close to spec, with variation.

Should always work:

#2 - 80 tap, 100 clear (105 free)
#4 - 100 tap, 130 clear (125 might work)
#6 - 120 tap, 150 clear (125/152 standard might work)
