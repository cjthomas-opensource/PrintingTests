This contains collars with a nominal 0.25" hole (plus clearance), and axles
with nominal 0.25" diameter (plus or minus clearance).

See the mechanical drawing for details and layout.

With "rough" settings, a hole 20 thou larger than the axle turned freely but
had contact (10 thou clearance). A hole 30 thou larger than the axle turned
freely without contact (but a bit of rattle) (15 thou clearance).

Calipers say the posts are slightly undersized (-10 to +0 thou) and the holes
are way undersized (-15 to -10 thou).

So, make holes wider than nominal by 20 thou, and then add clearance.
